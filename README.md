# Sorting fun!
A simple project to showcase the different sorting algorithms I'm studying. The goal is to create as clean and efficient code as I can, while comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. 

## Implemented Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort

## Planned Algorithms
- Quicksort
- Insertion Sort
- Patience Sorting
- Exchange Sort

..and more!

## TODO
- Research more sort algorithms
- More documentation for each algorithm
- Implement way to compare iterations/swaps each algorithm performs, especially for larger lists
