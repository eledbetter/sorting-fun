# Sorting fun!
A simple project to showcase the different sorting algorithms I'm studying. The goal is to create as clean and efficient code as I can.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort

## Planned Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Quicksort
- Insertion Sort
- Patience Sorting
- Exchange Sort

..and more!

## TODO
- Better organization (high prio)
- Research more sort algorithms
- Revamp testing (maybe use randomized lists?)
- More documentation for each algorithm
